feel free to use any part of this code elsewhere, but please link back here. under the AGPL license you also have to make your code open source.

uses manifest v3 so you could maybe port it to chrome. i'm not going to though because i'm spreading propaganda.

you can send PRs but i might not address them during the semester.
